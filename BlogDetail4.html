            I recently was asked this question at a conference I spoke at in the
            United Kingdom.<br />
            Then a few days later, funnily enough, this same question was the
            central topic at a panel<br />
            I moderated in San Francisco.<br />
            <br />
            Clearly, it’s a question top of mind for many of us, all over the
            world, who find ourselves<br />
            promoted or hired into a role where we’re not just a manager — but a
            manager of managers.<br />
            Is this brand of leadership any different? What should a new manager
            of managers consider in their role?<br />
            <br />
            Based on the research and insights we’ve gathered through Know Your
            Team, and the hundreds of<br />
            leaders I’ve interviewed over the years, here’s what I noticed as
            the biggest differences<br />
             — and things to keep in mind — as you’re managing managers.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Consider yourself a coach’s coach.</b><br />
            Autonomy in the workplace is table stakes. Dan Pink has written
            about it, Harvard Business<br />
            Review has written about it… We all intuitively know that as a
            manager you’re supposed to give<br />
            people the freedom and room to do their best work. However, with
            managing managers, the need<br />
            for autonomy becomes even more critical. Your success as a leader
            lies not in them delivering<br />
            the work — but helping them help their team deliver the work. So the
            amount of space you give<br />
            someone to do that as a manager, versus as an individual
            contributor, is much greater.<br />
            <br />
            But what does this tangibly look like? As a manager of manager, you
            play the role of <br />
            “coach”- except this time, you’re coaching a coach. You’re in a
            manager’s back pocket, ready to<br />
            listen when their stuck, frustrated, worried, or confused about
            something. You’re not helping them<br />
            make progress on specific tasks, but helping them think through
            sticky situations. What’s keeping<br />
            them up at night? Who’s the person on their team that they’re trying
            to figure out how to help perform<br />
            better? A sign of a great coach is one who asks a disproportionate
            amount of questions to their<br />
            team. As a coach’s coach, consider: Are you asking even more
            questions than you ever did before?<br />
            <br />
            <b>Make the answer to “Where are we going?” resoundingly clear.</b
            ><br />
            Vision is undoubtedly important to share as a leader. After all,
            your team needs to understand where<br />
            they are going and why it’s important to get there. But when you’re
            managing managers, this vision<br />
            needs to be exceedingly clear. Why? Because the folks you’re
            managing will need to answer the question,<br />
            “Where are we going?” for their direct reports. Your managers will
            need to find ways to align the<br />
            personal visions of their team members with the organization’s
            shared vision. So if you haven’t made<br />
            the answer to the question “Where are we going?” absurdly obvious,
            you can bet that the vision becomes<br />
            watered-down or distorted in some way once your managers share it
            with their direct reports. As a manager of<br />
            managers, you must clarify, repeat, reinforce, evaluate, and again
            clarify and repeat the answer to<br />
            “Where are we going?” over and over again.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Get comfortable crisscrossing.</b><br />
            When you’re managing managers, your focus is much more
            cross-functional — you’re working with business<br />
            units across the entire organization, instead of just one or two.
            There’s a popular misconception that<br />
            you get more freedom and control the “higher up” you go. But the
            reality is, when managing managers,<br />
            your freedom and control is contingent on more moving pieces. You
            have more stakeholders to consider,<br />
            more departments to coordinate with. Sure, you have the “final word”
            on more things and greater scope<br />
            than when you were only managing individual contributors. But now,
            as a manager of managers, your view<br />
            of the pie — and your responsibility of the pie — is bigger.<br />
            <br />
            <b>More of your time is spent recruiting, than ever.</b><br />
            According to the 1,000+ leaders in our online community in Know Your
            Team, one of the most important ways<br />
            a leader should spend their time is on recruiting and hiring. When I
            spoke with Edward Kim, CTO of Gusto,<br />
            he affirmed this. With 100+ engineers, 600+ total employees, and
            continuing to rapidly hire, Edward said that<br />
            most of his time goes toward recruiting folks — and that arguably
            may even have increased over time. This makes<br />
            sense, given how critical it is for who is a part of your
            organization. As the management scholar, Jim Collins<br />
            famously wrote, you’ve got to have the right people on the bus,
            first, before you drive it anywhere.
