            Virtual team building is top of mind for you.<br />
            Now that your team isn’t working in the same office anymore, the
            things you used to say to each other in the<br />
            hall – a simple “hello” in the mornings or a smile at someone as you
            walked by their desk – are absent. Gone are<br />
            post-lunch catch-ups over coffee or asking about how a coworker’s
            weekend was when you go to fill up your water bottle.<br />
            <br />
            So what do you do?<br />
            You google “virtual team building”… And what you find are
            instructions for how to hold a virtual happy hour and<br />
            a game where you guess fun facts about team members.<br />
            <br />
            Games and activities are charming, sure. But does it truly help
            build trust in a remote team?<br />
            Yes and no. They can help. But if playing online Scrabble together
            or sharing cat pictures are the only mechanisms<br />
            of virtual team building that you’re relying on, then the bonds of
            trust in your team will fray fast.<br />
            If you’re looking for more meaningful, more sustainable ways of
            building trust in a remote team, we have to dig deeper.<br />
            Ready to dive in? Let’s peer at the research from the past 25 years
            and best practices from the past 30 years to<br />
            fully understand how to build trust in a remote team – and how to
            get virtual team building right.<br />
            <br />
            <b>First: What do we mean by “virtual team building”?</b><br />
            One of the biggest misconceptions about virtual team building is
            that it’s only about helping our<br />
            team “feel good.” Warm ‘n fuzzy sentiments about each other on the
            team is unquestionable pleasant<br />
            – but that doesn’t mean you should optimize for them in a team. When
            a team that is constantly looking<br />
            to “feel good,” they end up flattering each other while avoiding
            speaking the truth. Conflict is<br />
            brushed under the rug. Preserving face is valued over honesty and
            mutual accountability. Your team’s<br />
            culture – and performance – will suffer, as a result.<br />
            Rather, to get virtual team building right, you’ll want to focus on
            fostering trust in a remote team.<br />
            Trust, after all, has enormous benefits to a team’s culture and
            performance that we often don’t fully recognize.<br />
            Studies have found how trust is linked to improving job performance,
            increasing employee engagement,<br />
            and opening up channels of communication. Trust is the oil in the
            engine that helps any team<br />
            (remote or co-located!) get to where it’s trying to go.<br />
            But trust can be a blanket word. Something we casually toss around,
            without precision. When we aspire<br />
            to “build trust,” we can lose our sense of what that means to begin
            with.<br />
            To do virtual team building right, we must then distill specifically
            the type – or types – of trust we<br />
            should be looking to cultivate.<br />
            <br />
            <b>The 2 types of trust to foster in a remote team</b><br />
            The two types of trust we should foster are what’s known as
            “affective trust” and “cognitive trust”<br />
            to scholars. Affective trust,” constitutes a form of trust based on
            emotional bond and interpersonal relatedness.<br />
            Cognitive trust, meanwhile, springs from reliability and
            competence.<br />
            Another way to think about it is: Affective trust is how you feel
            about the person’s intentions, while<br />
            cognitive trust is how well you think that person will act on their
            intentions.<br />
            To manage a remote team well, you need both affective and cognitive
            trust. The question is, then, how do<br />
            you exactly do this through virtual team building?
