                    Virtual team building is top of mind for you.<br>
                    Now that your team isn’t working in the same office anymore, the things you used to say to each other in the<br>
                    hall – a simple “hello” in the mornings or a smile at someone as you walked by their desk – are absent. Gone are<br>
                    post-lunch catch-ups over coffee or asking about how a coworker’s weekend was when you go to fill up your water bottle.<br>
                    <br>
                    So what do you do?<br>
                    You google “virtual team building”… And what you find are instructions for how to hold a virtual happy hour and<br>
                    a game where you guess fun facts about team members.<br>
                    <br>
                    Games and activities are charming, sure. But does it truly help build trust in a remote team?<br>
                    Yes and no. They can help. But if playing online Scrabble together or sharing cat pictures are the only mechanisms<br>
                    of virtual team building that you’re relying on, then the bonds of trust in your team will fray fast.<br>
                    If you’re looking for more meaningful, more sustainable ways of building trust in a remote team, we have to dig deeper.<br>
                    Ready to dive in? Let’s peer at the research from the past 25 years and best practices from the past 30 years to<br>
                     fully understand how to build trust in a remote team – and how to get virtual team building right.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>First: What do we mean by “virtual team building”?</b><br>
                    One of the biggest misconceptions about virtual team building is that it’s only about helping our<br>
                    team “feel good.” Warm ‘n fuzzy sentiments about each other on the team is unquestionable pleasant<br>
                    – but that doesn’t mean you should optimize for them in a team. When a team that is constantly looking<br>
                    to “feel good,” they end up flattering each other while avoiding speaking the truth. Conflict is<br>
                    brushed under the rug. Preserving face is valued over honesty and mutual accountability. Your team’s<br>
                    culture – and performance – will suffer, as a result.<br>
                    Rather, to get virtual team building right, you’ll want to focus on fostering trust in a remote team.<br>
                    Trust, after all, has enormous benefits to a team’s culture and performance that we often don’t fully recognize.<br>
                    Studies have found how trust is linked to improving job performance, increasing employee engagement,<br>
                    and opening up channels of communication. Trust is the oil in the engine that helps any team<br>
                    (remote or co-located!) get to where it’s trying to go.<br>
                    But trust can be a blanket word. Something we casually toss around, without precision. When we aspire<br>
                    to “build trust,” we can lose our sense of what that means to begin with.<br>
                    To do virtual team building right, we must then distill specifically the type – or types – of trust we<br>
                    should be looking to cultivate.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The 2 types of trust to foster in a remote team</b><br>
                    The two types of trust we should foster are what’s known as “affective trust” and “cognitive trust”<br>
                    to scholars. Affective trust,” constitutes a form of trust based on emotional bond and interpersonal relatedness.<br>
                    Cognitive trust, meanwhile, springs from reliability and competence.<br>
                    Another way to think about it is: Affective trust is how you feel about the person’s intentions, while<br>
                    cognitive trust is how well you think that person will act on their intentions.<br>
                    To manage a remote team well, you need both affective and cognitive trust. The question is, then, how do<br>
                    you exactly do this through virtual team building?
