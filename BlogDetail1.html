          <p>
            There’s been much talk about the degree to which political
            conversation in the workplace should happen.<br />
            <br />
            Most recently, opinions have been spurred by Basecamp’s announcement
            of their new company policies – the most<br />
            controversial of which they are asking employees to not engage in
            political discussions at work.<br />
            <br />
            (Full disclosure, we, as Know Your Team, are a spin-off of Basecamp
            back in 2014, and Basecamp holds minority<br />
            ownership in KYT to this day.)<br />
            <br />
            <b
              >The instinct to want to shut down political conversation is,
              admittedly, natural. </b
            >Discussing politics is<br />
            exhausting – irrespective of if it’s at work, at home, over dinner,
            via the phone. Personally, I can barely handle<br />
            watching the talking heads on the news yell at each other, let alone
            engage in conversation with a dear family<br />
            member whose source of facts is so different from mine that I cannot
            foresee any possible convergence on the horizon line.<br />
            <br />
            Furthermore, as a CEO, executive, or manager in the context of an
            organization whose purpose is to try to get work<br />
            done and make progress toward an outcome – it can feel perilously
            distracting. You may feel you’re playing the <br />
            role of a therapist in your one-on-one meetings or wondering to what
            degree of activism your team or your company<br />
            should be playing.<br />
            <br />
            It’s tempting to want to turn it all off. To say, “Feel free to have
            these conversations on your own time, in your<br />
            own private life, but not here – they’re dragging down the
            company.“<br />
            <br />
            <b
              >However, rarely does the shutting down of energy result in the
              felt, relieving experience of a release of energy.</b
            ><br />
            In fact, the opposite. Stifled feels, well, stifled. Our intention
            to unburden ourselves, in fact, can create<br />
            a greater burden for our team in the effort they must now put in to
            avoid sharing a part of themselves and<br />
            their lives. Leaders cannot extricate what the team feels is
            inextricably linked: our political lives and our work lives.<br />
            <br />
            Saying “don’t talk about this…” doesn’t lighten the load – it
            increases it.It doesn’t have to be this way.<br />
            <br />
            <b
              >While uncomfortable and arduous, I do believe it is possible for
              leaders to hold space for civil political<br />
              discourse in their own team.</b
            >Yes, it takes effort. And yes, outcomes may vary depending on your
            context.<br />
            <br />
            But, the reality is that there is no other reality. Political events
            and ideas affect the day-to-day lives of<br />
            our team members and our customers, whether that experience for you
            or them is pleasant or not, and whether that<br />
            experience is the same for you as it is for them.<br />
            <br />
            To not consider politics is to ignore one of the many dimensions
            influencing the context we’re given to lead.<br />
            After all, as a leader, considering the many factors in our context
            – be it the market, our competitors,<br />
            our customers, our board members, our partners, our employees – is
            essential to us leading well. Politics is<br />
            part of that context.<br />
            <br />
            Does this mean that everyone on your team needs to advocate for
            certain political candidates, or that everyone<br />
            should divulge where they stand on every political issue? By all
            means, no. One extreme does not have to replace another.<br />
            <br />
            An alternative path exists. Below, I share a few ideas on how we as
            leaders can answer the question,<br />
            “How political should I let my team be?” for ourselves – and what
            exactly we can do about it.
