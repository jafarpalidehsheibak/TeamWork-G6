            It’s inevitable: You’re going to disagree with your boss. No two
            people on the planet agree with each other<br />
            on everything, 100% of the time.<br />
            <br />
            “That’s a terrible idea,” you think to yourself, after listening to
            your boss share a decision she’s come to.<br />
            “She strongly needs to consider an alternate option.”<br />
            <br />
            et, managing disagreements at work is tricky — made only trickier if
            the person you disagree with is your boss.<br />
            Of all people, you don’t want that person to get defensive or
            misinterpret your disagreement as an attack.<br />
            You want whatever thing you’re arguing for to be considered, and
            hopefully enacted.<br />
            <br />
            The key is to share your opposing point-of-view respectfully — and
            effectively — so the outcome you’re looking<br />
            has a higher likelihood of happening.<br />
            <br />
            So, how do you do that? How do you disagree productively with your
            boss, or another senior leader on the team?<br />
            <br />
            In The Watercooler, our online community for leaders in Know Your
            Team, managers from all over the world suggested<br />
            taking these five steps when you and your boss disagree:<br />
            <br />
            <b>Peel back the layers of “why”</b><br />
            Start with the assumption that people are reasonable and make
            rational decisions. Then, ask yourself,<br />
            “Given that assumption, what would have to be true for them in order
            to cause them to make the decisions they did?”<br />
            Are there other priorities they’re managing that you’re not aware
            of? Are there other stakeholders who<br />
            have an interest in the outcome that you aren’t considering?
            Rigorously peel back the layers of their<br />
            rationale to figure out what those underlying reasons are.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Emphasize the common destination, not the divergent paths.</b
            ><br />
            You’re both on the same team. Remind them of this. While trying to
            explain your own view, extrapolate the<br />
            assumptions, beliefs, and values you both have in common. For
            example, you both care about the team’s success,<br />
            you both value speed over perfection, you both see X priority to be
            most critical. What you most-likely<br />
            differ on is the approach: The strategy to execute, the timeline,
            the resources, etc. Highlighting the <br />
            points of agreement re-centers the conversation: While the roads you
            mapped out are different, you both want<br />
            to end up in the same place.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Show, don’t just tell.</b><br />
            Evidence is compelling. How can you show — and not just tell — that
            your recommendation or idea<br />
            should be taken up? Is there anything that you can work on that
            directly contributes to the company<br />
            primary goals and illustrates your point? For instance, one
            Watercooler member discussed how she<br />
            started a project without many resources, and eventually recruited
            people who shared similar views to<br />
            build her case. It worked — her boss implemented the idea.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Consider: What is the one thing you can fix right now?</b><br />
            When we see a lot of fires, our urge is often to build a brand new
            fire station. However, in reality,<br />
            all we might need is to find the nearest fire hydrant to hook up to.
            If many things are broken and you<br />
            think you know a better way, avoid the desire to solve everything at
            once. Focus on just one thing<br />
            that can be a visible quick win. Connect to the fire hydrant, first.
            Then, you can better make the<br />
            argument to build the fire station for the neighborhood.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Ask yourself, “Do we really disagree on core beliefs?”</b><br />
            Sometimes, the gap between the opinions of you and your boss isn’t
            just a crack — it’s a chasm.<br />
            It’s much wider and deeper than you initially thought. This is
            important to pay attention to.<br />
            If you disagree with a coworker on core beliefs, then the change
            will be an uphill battle. You’ll<br />
            want to seriously consider if it’s worth the trouble. And, if it’s
            not, perhaps it’s not the right<br />
            company for you to be at. Core principles that you want to be
            aligned on include: your beliefs around<br />
            company culture, how managers see and respect employees, the ratio
            of autonomy vs. control, iteration<br />
            process, team structure and long-term goals.
