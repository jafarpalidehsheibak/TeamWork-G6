                With your new promotion, congratulations are in order. But so is trepidation:<br>
                 You are now faced with the precarious challenge of figuring out how to manage former peers.<br> 
                <br>
                I can feel the heat rising from your situation in merely thinking about it. Perhaps some of your former<br>
                peers were vying for the role that you now hold. You’re concerned that they’ll be ambivalent in their<br>
                work – or that folks might even try to undermine you right out of the gate. Gaining their support<br>
                (let alone the rest of the team’s!) feels dubious.<br>
                <br>
                What a precarious challenge, indeed!<br>
                <br>
                Despite the delicate nature of your team dynamics, there is a way for you, as a new manager, to create<br>
                 an environment where your team feels encouraged and energized for the work ahead – rather than defeated or threatened.<br>
                Here are two key areas I recommend considering first for how to manage former peers…<br>
                <br>
                <b>You’ll be tempted to overlook the one-on-one meeting. Don’t.</b><br>
                Do you feel the spotlight on you? As new managers, our attention often becomes heightened in moments<br>
                when we feel all eyes are on us. We watch our own words and actions more carefully when we know we’re<br>
                being watched. As a result, our all-team meetings, staff meetings, and project meetings<br>
                (i.e., meetings where the whole team is there) are the moments we tend to pay a lot of care and<br>
                attention to and prepare extensively ahead of time.<br>
                <br>
                However, in how to manage former peers, we often forget that the moments of 1:1 connection – our one-on-one meetings –<br>
                are when the spotlight shines the brightest. Especially as a new manager, our former peer will be extra<br>
                keen to understand how you will be approaching your new role. They’ll be looking to see your tone, your<br>
                presumptions – and will be basing their own tone and assumptions off of yours. And they’ll be looking for<br>
                this during the one-on-one meeting.<br>
                <br>
                For example, if you’re smug, vague, and ill-prepared for your one-on-one meetings, you can only imagine<br>
                how a former peer might feel discouraged and even bitter that you are in this role.<br>
                <br>
                Conversely, if you come to the one-on-one meeting with humility, openness to wanting to support your former<br>
                peer, and are prepared with specific questions, your former peer will likely leave that one-on-one meeting<br>
                feeling content and excited about you being in this new role.<br>
                <br>
                Specifically, when it comes to how to manage former peers, here’s how you might structure the agenda of your<br>
                first one-on-one meeting with a former peer:<br>
                <br>
                <b>Intro</b><br>
                Share gratitude. Thank them for taking the time to meet with you.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Share your purpose + ask for help</b><br>
                You view your true purpose in your new role as to support them.<br>
                You will rely on them to help you make decisions that benefit the team – and you’ll need their expertise and input.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Ask for feedback + initial thoughts</b><br>
                What do you hope stays the same about the team, going forward?<br>
                What do you hope changes / gets better in the team, going forward?<br>
                Anything about the team’s future that feels worrisome or uncertain for you?<br>
                What is something we’ve stalled for too long as a team, and should take immediate action on?<br>
                What can I change and adjust about my working style to ensure we have a positive working relationship?<br>
                In previously working together, what’s one area of development and growth you think I might look to focus on, for myself?<br>
               <br>
               <b>Closing</b><br>
               Reiterate gratitude.<br>
               Share next steps and takeaways.<br>
