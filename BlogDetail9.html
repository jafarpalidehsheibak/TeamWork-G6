                    This is a question I’ve consistently received over the years, and becomes more pronounced as we enter performance review season.<br>
                    It’s a particularly salient question given that, from our August 2020 survey of 1,087 managers and employees, 86% said they hold <br>
                    performance reviews – but only 23% of those people said they were “satisfied” with their performance review process.<br> 
                    In short:  86% of us are doing something that only 23% of us like.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>It’s worse than you think.</b><br>
                    Not only are a majority of us implementing a process that we’re not satisfied with, but the utility of the process itself is dubious:<br>
                    A 2019 study by Mercer found that only 2% of companies believe feel their performance process delivers exceptional value. In fact,<br>
                    Gallup shared how “traditional performance reviews and approaches to feedback are often so bad that they actually make performance<br>
                    worse about one-third of the time.”<br>
                    They further discovered that “only 14% of employees strongly agree their performance reviews inspire them to improve.”<br>
                    Yet, we still do performance reviews.<br>
                    We do them even though we feel like we’re twisting people’s arms to complete them. We do them even though we dread filling them out,<br>
                    ourselves.<br> 
                    How did we get here? And, most importantly:  Is there a better way?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>A long and winding road.</b><br>
                    How did we get here?<br>
                    performance reviews were first introduced as a rating system to help the U.S. military identify and dismiss poor performers.<br>
                    It was a tool to help with succession planning that was not shared with the soldiers and officers being evaluated. The original<br>
                    intention of performance reviews was to help the organization – not to help the individuals themselves grow.<br>
                    Fast forward to the present and our thinking has changed. Today, many companies want their performance reviews to be a tool <br>
                    used to give feedback and to an employee, so they can know how they can get better. In our survey with 1,087 managers and <br>
                    employees, we found 70% believed the primary purpose of reviews in an organization is to help a team member develop.<br>
                    However, traditional performance reviews are oftentimes simultaneously used to determine promotion, compensation, and raises. Other<br>
                    companies use them as a tool used for legal protection and to justify future firings.<br>
                    No wonder we can’t quite seem to have performance reviews that feel good or are useful:  It’s unclear for many organizations what<br>
                    the original purpose of the performance review – let alone what we should try to optimize for – is in the first place.<br> 
                    As a result, we’re left with a system with gaping problems when we think about how to give better employee performance reviews.<br>
                    Here’s what those exact problems of performance reviews are.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>A broken process, with 6 distinct problems.</b><br>
                    Here are the primary problems of performance reviews…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>“So, what’s this really for?”</b><br>
                    Performance reviews try to do too many things at once. Many teams will use performance reviews to do some mix of the following:<br>
                    offering advice on how to improve<br>
                    setting an employee’s bonus or raise<br>
                    deciding on a promotion<br>
                    justifying a future firing<br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, this diluted focus leads to the performance review not being able to do any of these things well.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>“Are you judging me, or coaching me?”</b><br>
                    Most performance reviews are tied to compensation and/or ratings. In our survey, we found that 63% of 1,087 people surveyed said<br>
                    that their performance reviews were tied to compensation. While popular, this backfires. This means the minute you try to offer<br>
                    feedback during a review, the person on the other side is bracing themselves for whether they got a raise or got promoted… not, <br>
                    “Oh is this feedback I should internalize in some way.” In fact, studies show how rankings trigger a fight-or-flight response in<br>
                    the brain. When performance reviews conflate growth with judgment, it damages the likelihood of growth.
