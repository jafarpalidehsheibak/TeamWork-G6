            <b>Who do you trust?</b><br />
            The first people who likely came to mind were your partner, your
            family, and your friends (hopefully).<br />
            <br />
            How about your boss? Your coworker? It’s harder to say.<br />
            <br />
            A 2016 study conducted by Edelman surveyed 33,000 people in 28
            countries. From it, they discovered: One in three people don’t<br />
            trust their employer. And only 24% of employees in this study
            believe their CEO exhibited highly ethical behavior.<br />
            <br />
            In our own Know Your Team survey this past year of 597 managers and
            employees, we found that folks were slightly more trustful<br />
            of one another: About 8% of employees said they rarely or never
            trust their manager. That’s almost 1 in 10 employees not trusting<br />
            their manager.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Why defining trust matters</b><br />
            Whether 1 in 3 employees or 1 in 10 employees don’t trust their
            managers — both are significant occurrences. Especially given<br />
            the amount of time we interact with our coworkers, and the projects
            and outcomes that are on the line, it’s startling.<br />
            <br />
            Are we really spending all this time with people we don’t trust?
            Should we be doing anything about this?<br />
            <br />
            To answer those questions, we first have to define “trust” clearly.
            Misconstrue what trust actually is, and you spend time on<br />
            the wrong things. Get it right, and building trust gets easier.<br />
            <br />
            <b>What trust is NOT: Likability</b><br />
            We often equate trust with likability. We think, “This is a nice
            person” or “This is the kind of person I’d want to hang out<br />
            with on weekends”… So we trust them.<br />However, that’s only part
            of the equation.<br />
            Consider someone in your company you don’t trust. You might like
            her. She’s affable, genuine and definitely tries her best.<br />
            But trusting her with a high-profile project? You hesitate — she
            hasn’t shown the track record you need to feel confident.<br />
            You don’t give her the big project because, honestly, you just don’t
            trust her enough.<br />
            So if you want someone to trust you, it’s not enough that they like
            you. It’s not enough that they think you have good intentions.<br />
            They’ve got to think you’re capable. They’ve got to think you have
            what it takes to prove something through.<br />
            You might think someone is a good person — but you don’t trust them
            to actually get the work done. You need both.<br />
            This is an important distinction because many leaders accidentally
            optimize for likability as a means to build trust. They try<br />
            to “be friends” with their direct reports, thinking it’ll mean their
            team will trust them more.<br />
            If we can internalize that trust is not likability, it causes us to
            not fall into the trap of trying to please everyone around us.<br />
            If we want to build trust, there’s something deeper we have to
            access.<br />
            So then, if trust isn’t likability, what is it?<br />
            <br />
            <b>What trust IS: Intentions + Behavior</b><br />
            In a 1998 paper, Denise M. Rousseau suggested this definition of
            trust: “A psychological state comprising the intention to accept<br />
            vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or
            behavior of another.”<br />
            In short, trust is two things: Intentions and Behavior. It’s
            people’s perception of who you are and their expectation of what you
            can do.
