            How do you build trust as a leader? The answer seems intuitive
            enough.<br />
            <br />
            For many of us, we hold company off-sites and run team-building
            activities. Informal lunches, monthly<br />
            social get-togethers, and one-on-one meetings are part of how we
            build trust at work.<br />
            We also thank our team publicly and give employee recognition for a
            job well done. And, we strive to be<br />
            transparent with company information during all-team meetings.<br />
            These are among the most popular ways to build trust because they
            work… Right?Wrong.<br />
            To my surprise, in our survey we ran this past fall with 597
            managers and employees, these three ways<br />
            to build trust were in fact viewed as the least effective by
            employees.<br />
            Specifically, these were
            <b>the 3 least effective ways to build trust as a leader:</b><br />
            <br />
            <b>Company retreats + team-building activities.</b>
            Only 1% of managers and employees who responded to the survey said
            that this was the<br />
            most effective way to build trust. This is fascinating, given the
            amount of money and<br />
            energy many companies spend planning company off-sites and
            team-building activities.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Thanking your team and giving recognition.</b><br />
            Only 4% of people said that this was the most effective to build
            trust in a team. While<br />
            this shouldn’t imply you should never thank your team, it goes to
            show there’s more to<br />
            building trust than doling out compliments.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Being transparent with company info.</b><br />
            Only 10% of managers and employees stated that this was the most
            effective way to build<br />
            trust in a team. No doubt that transparency is important in a
            company — if you want your<br />
            team to be able to make the same decisions as you, they need access
            to the same information<br />
            as you. But when it comes to building trust, perhaps it’s not as
            effective as we’d imagined it to be.<br />
            Now, just because these methods are not viewed as “most effective”
            for building trust at<br />
            work doesn’t mean you should stop doing these things, altogether.
            Rather, they may accomplish<br />
            other worthy goals in the organization. (For example, being
            transparent with company info<br />
            is helpful for alignment in a team.)
