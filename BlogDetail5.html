            swaying your team too much as "The Boss"

            When you’re a manager, something interesting happens:<br />
            You mention an idea off-hand, and all of sudden, it becomes a
            priority.<br />
            You casually ask a question out of curiosity, and all of sudden,
            everyone scrambles ASAP to get you an answer.<br />
            <br />
            As a leader, your opinion matters. But sometimes, it can matter too
            much. You can unintentionally<br />
            sway team members by stating your opinion prematurely. Or, you can
            accidentally quell perspectives<br />
            that are critical for you to hear.<br />
            <br />
            How do you keep this from happening? One of the managers in The
            Watercooler, our online community with<br />
            almost 1,000 leaders, kicked off this conversation recently. Below
            is a summary of the insightful,<br />
            practical replies.<br />
            <br />
            Here are 8 ways for you to compensate for your opinion weighing too
            much, as “The Boss”…<br />
            <br />
            <b>Assign others the task of disagreeing with you.</b><br />
            Force the hand, and create a safe space for someone to disagree. For
            example, in a meeting with ~5<br />
            people, a good leader might pick someone and say, “The four of us
            seem to be saying the same thing,<br />
            and I’m making it your job to disagree with us regardless of how you
            actually feel. So if you’re<br />
            forced to play the role of the disagreer, what’s your argument?”<br />
            <br />
            <b>Give someone less experienced a chance to speak first.</b><br />
            This helps prevent folks from just shutting down and saying, “Yep
            sure, what that person said.”<br />
            Even if the person is way off the mark in their opinion, it either
            signals you should spend more<br />
            time working with them, or it causes the team pivot on the original
            idea after hearing others.<br />
            One Watercooler member mentioned how he was recently listening to
            Great at Work and a high performing<br />
            example company followed this practice: Most junior employees shared
            their thoughts first, most <br />
            senior shared their thoughts last.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Have the person with the strongest opinion speak last.</b><br />
            A strongly-held viewpoint can drown out any potential for diversity
            of thought to emerge.<br />
            So have the person who has already thought about an issue and formed
            a strong opinion speak last.<br />
            This is also helpful because they’re the least likely to be biased
            by what everyone else says.<br />
            <br />
            <b
              >Ask others what they think before jumping in with your own
              thoughts.</b
            ><br />
            One Watercooler member shared that he’ll often send people a link to
            a story, article, idea, etc.<br />
            and ask people, “Thoughts?” to see what he gets back. This helps
            provoke thoughts from other people,<br />
            in an unfiltered way, before you insert your own.<br />
            <br />
            <b
              >Ask everyone to explain their thought-process, not tell you their
              opinion.</b
            ><br />
            This keeps the people with opinions — but perhaps more trivial
            reasoning behind them — from<br />
            dominating the conversation (and wasting everyone’s time). In
            addition, understanding how someone<br />
            is coming to a conclusion is sometimes just as valuable, if not
            more, than the conclusion itself.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Use phrases like “you’re the expert.”</b><br />
            When talking to people about areas that they’re a specialist in,
            affirm that they are the person<br />
            who has the required knowledge and expertise. This helps make it
            clear that your view isn’t any more<br />
            correct than theirs.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Ask for advice.</b><br />
            When you say to someone, “I need your advice,” you can open the door
            wide to getting useful feedback<br />
            from your direct reports. The statement both indicates openness to
            fresh ideas, as well as a clear<br />
            request for that person’s personal viewpoint.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Admit what you’re unsure about or struggling with.</b><br />
            Try saying something like, “I’m pretty sure I know the direction I
            want to go, but I want to be sure<br />
            I haven’t overlooked something important. Will you review this with
            me, and poke holes in my idea?” Or<br />
            “I’m having a tough time figuring this out…” Good managers
            understand this leads to a very different<br />
            dynamic. Even if you end up sticking to your original plan, people
            are more likely to feel respected<br />
            for being asked to help vet the idea. You’ll get valuable input,
            regardless.
